1.11
* nrep in coneB reset as the minimum of n^2 and 1000
* update 'a' again according to 'h' if nrep == the upper limit of iterations to the avoid size mismatch problem
* sm reset to be 1e-5
* add a line to set check = 1 in coneB if any edge in delta is chosen; otherwise set check = 0

* change 'equal' to be in check_irred
* set addrownums = FALSE in order to avoid row name errors in check_irred
* scale b2 by length in while loop of coneB

1.13
* change & to be && change | to be || with () to pass Gcc test

1.15
* tail(., addrownums = FALSE) is deprecated. Use tail(., keepnums = FALSE) instead.

1.16
* update the eight shape constraint subroutines such that they are the same as those used in cgam

1.17
* add mixture variance-covariance matrix in constreg, c.i. for bhat, c.i. for fhat, a summary method, and a vcov method for this.

1.18
* change nrep to be n in coneBCpp, coneACpp, etc.
* change solve to be solve(xmat * xmat.t(), xmat * ny, arma::solve_opts::fast)

1.19
* return pmat in coneA

1.20
* fix the error in the description of coneA: face is for polar cone.
* not use arma::solve_opts::fast, which is not stable

1.21
* qprogCpp and coneACpp are changed s.t. they can take sparse matrices as inputs.

1.22
* change the precision number sm = 1e-8 back to be 1e-11 in the src file.
